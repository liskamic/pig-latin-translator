# pig-latin-translator
Terribly overengineered translator into Pig Latin.

Java code that translates a string (word, sentence, or paragraph) into “pig-latin” using the following rules.
* Words that start with a consonant have their first letter moved to the end of the word and the letters “ay” added to the end.
  * Hello becomes Ellohay
* Words that start with a vowel have the letters “way” added to the end.
  * apple becomes appleway
* Words that end in “way” are not modified.
  * stairway stays as stairway
* Punctuation must remain in the same relative place from the end of the word.
  * can’t becomes antca’y
  * end. becomes endway.
* Hyphens are treated as two words
  * this-thing becomes histay-hingtay
* Capitalization must remain in the same place.
  * Beach becomes Eachbay
  * McCloud becomes CcLoudmay
